# Inital Flask Demo

When fully built, the webpage will show a text box and then input for how much of the article to summarize. By pressing submit, the web app will use Gensim to use a Pagerank Algorithm for summarizing the text. Word count is available, which is a fascinating approach, as well. 

This demo has a tremendous amount of potential, built into a Read It Later app (i.e., Instapaper, but it can summarize five articles for you to skim over email) or an app like Anki. I think text and speed to mastery still have promise and am glad to get this demo as a starting step.
